I've got the Fiber7 Internet subscription from  [0] and I'm very happy with the service they provide. I got the service up and running in  after contacting them and never had problems with it (albeit I've only been using it for  or so). I live at  and the UTP cables that were used for the wired network setup are CAT5e, which were designed for 1 Gbps. It would be weird if the cables from your apartment were different. The maximum transfer speed I managed to reach was ~750 Mbps, directly connected to the SFP converter through one of the living room Ethernet ports.

But I would like to give a little tip here: Of course, I do not know whether this would be ""approved"" by the administration, but there are various dust filter mats for ventilation (supply and exhaust air).   times ask for advice regarding ""dust filter fleece"". A distinction is made between the G-classes for coarse filters and the F-classes for fine filters. I think that in the apartments the filter classes G are sufficient (e.B. G3 or G4), since particulate matter is more likely to mean car or factory exhaust gases (I'm not an , I can also be wrong here)... Important with the filter is certainly the ""air permeability"", i.e. the air flow must not be stopped too much. Otherwise, it would lead to ""pressure losses"" (e.B. an air pressure difference would arise if more air is sucked out of the apartment than can be pumped in).

Finally I got information that I would have liked to have had long before: - One problem is the  lowering of the heating. This is . The low-temperature underfloor heating installed here (part of the  standard) has an inertia of 4-. However, since the heating only starts at , the floor only gets really warm . But I would like to have a warm floor in the bathroom from .  I'm usually already at work. Especially since the  lowering with  and low-temperature underfloor heating achieves practically no saving effect. The water temperature in the heating circuit of the underfloor heating (flow temperature) depends on the outside temperature and is a MAXIMUM of 35 degrees. In the  weather conditions, it is already very cold at . But there is the  subsidence. So the heating doesn't do much. , the heating goes off completely, but takes 4- until the heat in the apartment is noticeable (s. o.). At  the outside temperatures are e.g. T. so high that the flow temperature is much lower, e.g. B. only 24 degrees. This makes sense because it saves energy. The apartments have excellent thermal insulation and ventilation with heat recovery.  it takes a while until it gets warm, because of the inertia of the heating. And then comes the  subsidence again, which prevents a pleasant warmth , when you need it most. With. T. however, the heaters do not seem to be set correctly because these target temperatures are not reached at all. If not even the valve for the heating circuit is open - and this was probably not an isolated case - then too much has probably gone quite quickly and sloppily before moving in to be able to keep the move-in date. The  lowering makes practically no sense in terms of energy and economy with the heating technology used here and leads to a loss of comfort that does not have to be.

Despite the information sheet ""Using underfloor heating correctly"" and  ""what does  mean"" remains for me: FAR TOO MUCH FOREIGN INSTEAD OF SELF-DETERMINATION   The fact that the guidelines for MINERGIE certified buildings are different from those for conventional buildings can be seen in the given room temperatures (from 20 to 21°C in residential, 16 to 18°C in bedrooms and 22°C in bathrooms) which in my opinion are an impudence and the quality label should be: MINERGIE YES, SAVE YES BUT DO NOT FREEZE. I can't decide for myself what I mean by ""comfortable living feeling"" and can adjust my room temperature according to my needs. One thing is clear.

On the other hand, there are not even enough parking spaces for the  neither in the underground gars nor in the quarter, let alone for  of the approx. 600 apartments in Erlenmatt West. The traffic-calmed quarter is a nice idea that I welcome. In practical terms, the  of the automobile is far from over and  need parking spaces. The parking lot is not recognizable as ""illegal"". There is free access from the Riehenring and there are no prohibition signs. In terms of traffic, therefore, there is nothing to indicate illegality. Thus, it is not clear to me why the term ""illegal"" is used in this context. Should the  get a guilty conscience as a result? Experience has shown that this is certainly not the case. Greening the whole place would certainly have been a much more cost-effective and beautiful alternative with less objection potential. Is just my personal opinion. But at least there is a lot of green in the district with the Erlenmattpark, the future Max Kämpff Platz and the green courtyards. I only have concerns that the wave, with its covered retreats, could develop into a playground for  or . From my window, I have already observed several times how  boil and put their syringes on the roof of the Horburg Tunnel. If the start of construction for the wave is not in , then it would be welcome if the square was at least provisionally greened, e.g. B. with inexpensive lawn in connection with the construction work of the front part and the tree grove.

You don't do that otherwise. Of course, it is worrying when you have the  in the immediate vicinity. But I think it's positive that you at least see quite a lot of . This fact is something.

5694c08525c80f03028b45c1,"  : To 1.: So usually you take care of a (rental) parking space when moving into an apartment, if you need one. Are all the spaces in the underground car parks really already sold/rented? It has been known for years that the city will be built on the 'illegal parking lot'.  can arrive very comfortably by public transport or park in the P+R car park at adischer ahnhof. If the visit stays longer, you could ask e.. here on the , if someone does not need his parking space for  (because of holidays etc.) and for a small fee or a good bottle of wine 'sublet'. Official visitor parking would not work anyway, but would usually be provided by  or . People who work in the area, staffed (many years of experience at the previous place of residence). To 2.: I meet the  with my  anyway  on the pavement, in the tram and everywhere in the city. They don't do anything to us and you can't conjure them up. The +A site at the Wiesenkreisel was already there before the Erlenmatt development and is certainly doing valuable work. ut what you need to get a better grip on are the negative side effects. Open drug trafficking etc. in the residential quarter, of course, is not possible. The best remedy for this, however, is a public square with a lot of activity such as..dem planned youth café, the trend sports hall, events on the square, etc. A good example of this is the Claramatte: Since the redesign (attractive playground, picnic tables, etc.) and the presence of the  play actions, the place is at least during  a safe and usually clean place where we like to stay. On the other hand, a dingy, unlit parking lot is probably the best invitation for all sorts of unwanted guests and activities...   ",0.04584565758705139
5694c08525c80f03028b45c1,"  I don't k what you mean by ""normally"", but it has nothing to do with moving in if there are no sufficient parking spaces from the beginning. Since it is of no use to worry about it before moving in... I had no possibility of a parking space in the underground garage when I applied for the apartment: everything was already gone. Meanwhile, some offer their pitches for rent, but that doesn't really matter. To your example with public transport or the P+R car park: These are useful tips, but not a permanent solution in my opinion. With so many apartments in the district (all building plots together), it should be possible ""some parking spaces"" for  etc. to provide. To , cases occur in which the parking spaces in the underground car park are not used properly or incorrect parking is reported. If it doesn't work out here, then it doesn't matter with the  parking spaces (if  park there). In addition, an example on my part: You have 4 full shopping bags (illegal parking is no longer available,  is not allowed to be driven by car) and live at the end of the . How do you bring everything home? Do not say each bag individually or you will stop ""briefly"" in the 20 zone on  (is also not allowed)... I have absolutely no objection to the work of the  office. I think it's great that you offer this possibility. But it is precisely these ""side effects"" that, in my opinion, put the city terminal in a different light. And they say it themselves about the Claramatte: ""at least during  safer and usually cleaner"" So I interpret: not really cleanly solved. It doesn't help me that everything is ""OK"" during  and then  I can't stay there ""in peace"" (especially not with the sum of money to be spent on the city terminal).

5694c08525c80f03028b45c1,"  It will probably already be the case that some  could no longer rent a place in the underground car park when they moved in. But I simply can't imagine that all the cars in the said ""illegal parking lot"" and these same  are.

Word seems to have gotten around and even on this huge area it is slowly getting tight with vacancies! I am curious to see how the situation will develop in the future.

You can't enjoy the advantages of our new sustainable quarter (2000-watt area!) with the spacious green and open spaces and at the same time drive directly to the front door by car and park for free... And as for the example with the 4 full shopping bags: I don't want to sound 'missionary' or demonize the car as such: But in Basel, no one really has to go shopping by car if it's not heavy furniture. All shops are easily accessible by public transport, even the nearby foreign countries (Weil by 8-seater tram, Lörrach by train). Instead of one bulk purchase per week, it is better to go shopping two to three times on foot or by bike, e.B. on the way home from work. Then there are not four heavy bags, and vegetables and salad are still fresh. With a shopping trolley you can also transport heavy things (e.B bottles) and dispose of the old glass on the way there, e.B. at the musical theater.

Due to the location of the garage entrances and the flow of people out of the site, many people who live some distance away from the container in the photo use it.  My apartment overlooks it, and I see many cars drive out of the garages, stop outside and use this container.  If it's full they don't care, they just dump their sack anyway.  As it's a direct problem for me, I always walk around the site to find another if the one directly outside is full.  Usually the second nearest container is half empty.  Even at , when we had an even bigger problem than , I was able to find a nearly empty container on the other side of the site.   I think that management could do some education of  to help the situation.  For example, if they wrote to , showing with a map where all the containers are located, and indicating clearly which container they are expected to use.  They could also explain that it's not acceptable to dump the sacks when the first container approached is full, and that in this case one must seek an alternative.  When I have seen people dumping sacks and spoken to them about it, they have claimed that they are unaware of the locations of the other containers as they do not routinely walk that way.

However, it is funny that you should point out the ability to read a contract, as I have just reviewed my 18 page contract, which I have also carefully read before signing, and found not a single mention of any such kind. Therefore, any previous statements such as 'people chose to live here  because of the car free zone' and the discussion about unknown majority/minority views false. Furthermore, we've received a letter from , dated , stating that PARKING is prohibited in front of the buildings, BECAUSE the road will be driven on soon. As mentioned before, I have no interest in a big fight among us , all I wanted to point out is that because from an ecological standpoint there is zero benefit from closing  to any kind of traffic, incl. ""Zubringer"" for private people actually living in these premises, and that to the  contrary, it is unrealistic and cumbersome for many different reasons. Those reasons include people with (even temporary) disabilities and walking several times for quite a big distance to transport heavy goods, such as  shoppings, garden ware, and coop orders. Again, i am also against parking and speeding and even heavy traffic, but I'm trying to be realistic. Nobody owning a car in these buildings will sell it because of this reason, and for those of us relying on public transport it just signifies a major downside. Furthermore, I am not trying to force my views on everyone else but trying to voice concern about this development, which affects me as much as anyone living on the 'wrong side' of the courtyard.

5770d3e5b3df2c14028b457c,"  Hi , I must write in English as my German cannot explain well enough how to prevent this. It seems to be the problem you are having is that someone is using your details to order something online with a payment slip (so to pay after the good are received, not before with credit card etc.), therefore you are only informed about this once the payment deadline has been missed via another letter to your address. I find it hard to believe that internet stores are still using this as a payment method in current times when such thefts can happen - but that's another story. This seems to be a common issue in Basel currently. They simply check your name and address on the outside of the building postbox, then they order something online using this address and a similar email address to match your name, then they are notified when the package is delivered, run to your postbox and take it, without you ever knowing. Then 3- you get another letter from the online shop saying you have not paid XX CHF for the order. They therefore already have the goods and have not paid. One way you can prevent this happening it to register yourself and your address on  , then as soon as a delivery to your address has been entered in the system you are notified and can see exactly where this has come from - so you are made aware before the delivery and can then be ready to get to the package before the criminal or contact the retailer and inform them about this scam (however,  this doesn't work for goods shipped by other independent courier companies- but most are done by swiss post). I'd recommend that everyone registers themselves and their address on  - online registration and they send you a letter with a code to confirm your address.

577e6399644c587f008b4567,"   here: Both Kannenfeldpark and Schützenmattpark have a long and rich history and were carefully designed. My personal   made the plans for Kannenfeld which used to be a cemetery and only later became a park. The English landscape park was very popular, which allowed organic, natural forms and was inspired by romantic paintings. Gardens and parks have been designed throughout history by rules of order, harmony, human scale and of course with a specific function in mind. These things give them meaning and allows us to relax and rest.  I am not exaclty sure why, but comtemporary „greens“ look like a bad caricature. Sure they are better than wasteland, and honestly the playground looks really freaking cool to me. The random linear pathways through the stone field are not exactly where people would want to stroll. Parks, just like cities, usually get more beautiful when older and filled with history, but Erlenmattpark is likely not the finest example of human creation.   ",0.758438840508461

If you want an area off limits to humans why not stick it in the middle of the park, why even have such an area in a small inner city park?? the park in general looks too strict and over designed, yet messy and not user friendly for recreation, I am sure googlemaps  will at least find it an interesting layout.

We all prefer to be there with our four-legged . This becomes problematic  and in  time already , when the paws certainly need to run out again. Then you are not safe in the Horburgpark or in the Lange Erlen. We all know the reasons. Of course, we dog s are interested in a peaceful coexistence here in the neighborhood and of course in hygiene. Of course, there is not only pollution by dog feces and the meadows are after picnics etc. often left as a garbage dump. However, this is no excuse. There are also positive examples. In any case, even dog s do not want to step into feces, not even into broken bottles or barbecue waste. To all those who leave a pile and also to all those who do not dispose of normal waste properly: just pick it up. The  team has already talked to some of you about the situation for dog s here in the neighborhood. The aim of the Erlepföetli- is to apply for a place for dogs OUTSIDE the Erlenpark. Where no park  feel disturbed. There are areas that are suitable for this. For both sides, this would be a win-win situation, as the dogs would not have to do their business on the asphalt paths of the Erlenpark, where the heaps certainly do not belong. In addition, most dogs have learned not to do their business on paths. In our opinion, having a contact point for the numerous dog s is an enrichment for all .

You would simply have the place, in front of the fossil building, which is to become a meeting zone (only wonders for whom?

To ensure that it is only for  to the Erlenmattquartier: grill a part of it (the grid does not have to be that high, ), add a ramp. Tickets to serve the ramp can only be pre-ordered by the  for their visit (for 1 or more days).

58abf53478c6595f008b45fc,"  Dear Mr. , you have often brought the ""argument"" with the lease in other contributions and that ""you knew it before signing it"". At this point I would like to say that this is ABSOLUTELY NOT true! I do not know in which construction site you live and whether possibly. the leases for the individual building plots are different. BUT in my rental agreement the following is stated under point 8.4 Parking of motor vehicles ""... THE USE OF VISITOR PARKING SPACES BY THE TENANT OR THE PERSONS LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSEHOLD IS PROHIBITED..."" Therefore, I kindly ask you not to use your ""argument"" in the future. :) Because it seems that not everyone knew before signing the lease that there will be NO visitor parking... Likewise, nowhere in the lease is it written that the large square would be created or concreted and only accessible to pedestrians... I totally agree with !   ",-0.6425396967679262

58abf53478c6595f008b45fc,"  @ : Local conditions or not! After all, it is a CONTRACT, whether standard or not. When I moved into the district, everything was still one big construction site (construction sites G & E were even still in the construction phase). Not even the streets were paved at that time or clearly ""defined"" how they will run, let alone you could google the Erlenmatt (square) and ""find all the information beautiful"" as Mr.  explained. At that time, there was almost NO information about this. Since I also have no clairvoyant abilities, I wonder just how you come up with it you should have ""seen it immediately"" in the local conditions?! Again for all ""car-free  "" (should not be an insult): I have resigned myself to the situation and we have a really great quarter (except for some really unpleasant things)!

You can stick to your principles and points of view as much as you want. I have absolutely nothing wrong with that and even respect it. But one should not simply argue ""one knew everything before signing the lease (which was obviously NOT so)"" and what else was additionally presented here as ""proof"". Just because some here are convinced that everything is super great here in the neighborhood as it is that others do not have to think or tell these people, you ""can cancel the lease""... I am not bothered by the lack of  parking spaces, but rather by the intentional or unwanted incompetence of the  to dispose of their garbage correctly. It's getting worse and worse I have the feeling... Everywhere in the district there are either Bebbisacks, pieces of furniture, half-full plastic bags, newsprint, protein cans. etc. room.

I can't remember the details but it was quite obvious. There were things described in it that did not exist in our apartment. If you had something about  parking spaces, then that was just as simple a copypaste error. I am already one of the first to live here. So I know what they are talking about, but it was clear to me that there will be no parking spaces. At that time, the garage was still half leeer, because many simply put their car outside on the construction site and wanted to save the 180.- chf for the garage. That's why I didn't feel sorry for those who came too late at some point and there was no more room in the garage. But when it comes to garbage, I completely agree with them!

5a15bf88fa57095d008b459c,"  I wrote to the  and criticized the nonsense that the barrier in the Green City lowers long before a train to Zurich enters the station. That's just the way it is, is the answer.

5a15bf88fa57095d008b459c,"  It's not easy: Trains run on so-called trains. Block routes: A block route is a section of track that is secured for the railway and which it can travel on free of obstacles. This means that the barriers must all be completely shut down before the train gets the green light. Therefore, all barriers close to  before the train Goes leimbach (barrier behind the Sihlbogen, barrier Butzenstrasse). The fact that at the same time the barrier at the Spinnereiplatz (i.e. the one in the middle of our area) goes down is surprising. Because the train stops again before. BUT: Directly after the  stop, after the level crossing, the line becomes double-tracked and thus again passable without obstacles. From the point of view of the , it is probably nonsensical to introduce a block line that leads from  to , then another,  long, to the double-track line. And then a next one to . Of course, we can try to make representations to the  - I would not expect too much from it. If I have to consider whether I prefer to have a train that ensures that it can travel a route without obstacles, but I have to wait at the barrier, then I accept my waiting. And yes, of course, as long as there is still a construction site, we cannot go directly to Butzenstrasse and cross the railway line twice. But later it goes over the area, at least for the .

5a15bf88fa57095d008b459c,"  Wow , thanks for the detailed explanation! I heard somewhere that at some point (probably when the construction site is no longer) the train station should change to the other side of the track. Do you know anything about that?   ",0.6236615274101496
5a15bf88fa57095d008b459c,"  @: No, I don't know anything more precise. I've heard that too. It would still be chic if you could get in and out on both sides. But let's let that come to us.   ",-0.04948940873146057

Security, I'm with you, that's important, but the one with the barrier at the spinning place is total nonsense. What is the consequence?  People are still slipping under the barrier, of course this is forbidden and it is about personal responsibility, but it is still done. I have already heard this, and saw it myself  after jogging, and it does not surprise me. If I had to catch a train urgently, see that it hasn't even arrived yet, and the barrier is still down, I don't know what I would do then... I will probably also write to the , then you have one more request and then see if I can collect signatures, hopefully with a few people.  I wish you all a super nice day   ",-0.644960593432188
5a15bf88fa57095d008b459c,"  Apparently, I have a different sense of time or some expertise. In my opinion, the time between lowering the barrier and the entrance is relatively short. The barrier is coupled to the entry or exit signal. This means that the barrier is closed and reports this to the computer in the control center and this provides the train with the route. This is timed to the timetable, if the train is then a little late, then it may take a little longer until the barrier lifts again. I do not know the exact operating rules of the SZU, but it will not be possible to optimize much more without risking even more delays and the  will hardly approve boarding and disembarking on both sides.

5a15bf88fa57095d008b459c,"  If you have it pressant and are close to it, one or even  of closed barrier is a long time - which seems useless if there is no train to be seen.

5a5d0d4dff13f45c008b45bc,"  Dear  , In addition to the visualization of personal consumption, comparative data for each type of energy is currently also being visualized. Currently, the average consumption per square meter within a property is available for this purpose. In order to determine the average consumption, the available consumption data of all units are summed up and divided by the total area (square meters) of the property. This value is then multiplied and displayed by the size of the currently visualized apartment. This results in a comparative value for the average consumption within a property, with a comparable size. The prerequisite for this value to be determined is the correct recording of the living space in the building master data. Further comparison functions, such as the presentation of the 's consumption or own energy consumption targets, are currently being planned.

5b0e7ccce75bc40063447516,"  Dear  of our manegg estate We checked the ventilation systems  and found that everything was fine. The supply air, which is blown into the apartments, corresponds exactly to the outside temperature. The controlled ventilation cannot cool the supply air, otherwise it would be an air conditioning system, which is not allowed in a 2000-watt building. In order for the heat outside and the apartment to stay cool, you should darken your rooms (especially during ) as much as possible. With the existing Rafflamellenstoren this is no problem.  protection measure improves the thermal insulation of the windows and can prevent up to 80 percent of solar radiation. Even with the best insulated and darkened rooms, correspondingly high outside temperatures can sooner or later ensure that  heat also penetrates into the interior of the house. Once living and working spaces have heated up, the main aim is to lower the room temperature again. When there is a lot of heat outside in , clever ventilation is particularly important. This means that you better keep the windows closed during  and darken them as described above. This prevents the heat from passing through the windows to the inside. Nevertheless, the rooms will heat up a bit during  and the room temperature will thus rise. Therefore, take advantage of the cooler times of  in the evening, at  and  for ventilation. When ventilating, ideally open the windows all at the same time and preferably completely, so that the air can circulate as much as possible. By airing correctly at the right times, the heated air in the rooms is best transported to the outside. We hope that you can reduce the room temperature in your apartment with the proposed measures and are happy to answer any questions you may have.   ",0.08327627182006836

5b280d4c7a85a100690ec5bd,"  Thank you, for very interesting contribution and measurement. I agree with 1-2 degrees cooler. Two questions:  1) Do I understand correctly that cooling is not via supply air but via radiators in the floor? In other words, for temperature in the apartment it does not matter whether windows are open or closed? (In other buildings, cooling only works with the windows closed..) 2) If ventilation simply brings outside air, then the temperature of the supply air can rise to 30 degrees with outside temperature, right?   ",0.6707139238715172

There are apparently different ""types"" of comfort ventilation. , I only knew the one that cools down in . However, this normally conducts the air through the ground. It is cooled down. However, the air for our apartments will be in the south and north of the building to approx. 4m height sucked in (where the no smoking signs are). @: Shutting down completely is probably a bad idea. The CO2 content of the air would probably rise too much. However, the air is not completely sucked in from the outside. When they moved in, they had told us that in 24 the air will be completely replaced three times. Therefore, the cold should actually stay in the system a little longer. In addition, if the floors cool the room air, it should actually stay cool much longer. Best regards,    ",0.053450435400009155
5b280d4c7a85a100690ec5bd,"  Dear Mr. ,  Thank you very much for your interesting contribution and the measurements in your apartment! In the case of a new building, it always takes a while for all technical installations to function as ordered by the . Especially when the building technology is as complex as in the Green City. The main reason that the apartments do not cool down at  are the floors, ceilings and walls, which heat up strongly during  and release the stored heat at . If the apartment heats up very strongly during , the heat is no longer brought out of the apartment with the controlled ventilation, because the air exchange is too small. That is why it is so important to shade the windows during  by means of the existing venetian blinds and the awning on the loggia, so that as little sunlight as possible penetrates into the apartment. Equally important is to ventilate the apartment as soon as it gets a little cooler outside, preferably by ""cross-ventilation"". The lease article regarding ""free-cooling"" has apparently caused some confusion. The wording in the leases is as follows: ""Neither room humidification nor cooling are provided."" and ""Free-cooling in  with passage of cool groundwater through heating circuit is provided."" The free-cooling system is mainly used to regenerate the geothermal probes (i.e. the heat source for heating and hot water) in  so that sufficient geothermal energy is available in . So it is not air conditioning but removes the floors with the help of the floor heating a maximum of 2 to 4 ° degrees. This means that the surface temperature of the floors should be slightly cooler than the room temperature in .  we reprogrammed the ventilation systems together with a .  the heat recovery is only activated when the outside temperature is less than 16° degrees. This means that cooler air is blown into the apartments at  than before.  it may be that we will receive complaints about draughts in the apartments. Depending on this, we will have to adjust the systems again. We very much hope that the mentioned measure will bring some cooling and make the  more bearable for all .

All the quarter was still an industrial quarter, the noise barrier that stands there was also sufficient, But with the new Green City development, this noise protection construction is no longer sufficient.  Therefore, it does not really make much sense to ask for an extension. 1.  when the overall project is finished, a modern type of noise barrier with side slats and on top of standing arches should be considered.  But this would only bring about 4 dB. 2.  the best variant is to cover the highway with a construction, as is common in many major cities around the world, The cost-effective variant for the region would be a glass construction that would bring about 20 dB.  But I think even this only makes sense when the entire quarter is developed and buys potent  who have rented business premises.

The requirements for noise protection are regulated in the applicable Environmental Protection Act (USG) and the applicable Noise Protection Ordinance (LSV). The existing noise protection measures in front of the Entlisberg Tunnel were dimensioned during construction in such a way that the relevant immission limit values as defined in the LSV are complied with.   In the Greencity residential development area, the old noise-insensitive industrial and commercial buildings were dismantled and noise-sensitive living space was realized. In the case of such a conversion, the noise protection obligation lies with the . According to Art. 31 of the LSV, the  must prove compliance with the immission limit value and, if necessary, implement noise protection measures at his own expense. Thus, there is no noise protection obligation on the part of the   for this area.   The environmental obligations of  have thus been fulfilled and an extension of the existing noise barriers to the Entlisberg Tunnel is not planned.   We hope to have served you with this information.   ",0.5563833806663752

The ventilation heating is set via the temperature sensors per room, these should already work. However, I have already reported that the temperature sensors generally display too high values.

I think it's great that you think about the care of your terrace floor and will be happy to help you.

After that, the floor should first be cleaned with the degree or green ex depending on the contamination and then treated with the wood special oil. We recommend that you carry out this process  so that you can enjoy the ground for a long time. Your soil will turn gray over time, this is normal. But with the wood special oil he is then protected. Larch wood is a crack-prone wood, it is unavoidable that your floor will crack over time, this happens with and without treatment.

5bdf39c1fe3532006a1ad55f,"  Good morning. Floor heating might only be a part of the cold flat problem. If you touch the ventilation box in your reduit, the ""Zuluft"" box (air being pushed into the flat) is very cold (at least in my flat), so might come from outside. There should be a central heat exchanger, so warming up incoming air with the air being pulled out of the flat, but doesn't seem to do anything. So increasing heating might just waste energy...   ",-0.6230071187019348
5bdf39c1fe3532006a1ad55f,"  The Zuluft is colder, minus 4 degrees than the Abluft = 17 ° or colder (if you have only 20 ° as I have actually) This has explained Mr.  .    ",-0.1921178624033928
5bdf39c1fe3532006a1ad55f,"  The building complies with minergie-p-eco standards. See e.g. . The regulation is very strict about using fossil energy for heating. Heat recovery from waste air is mandatory, but this alone will never bring the fresh air temperature above the exhaust air temperature. Technically there is no obvious mistake with both, the ventilation and the floor heating. I share the opinion that the flat is cold compared to typical apartments. What we can and should enforce is a minimum temperature of 21 degrees in each room, what we and others currently do not achieve. Turning the ventilation off is not a reasonable option, because it will messup the heat contoll system. A beter option is to shift the operating points e.g. from a minimum air exchange rate of 100 m^3/min in our flat to e.g. half of that. This would actually save energy (as long as all windows stay closed) and I see no reason why this would harm the minergie standards.   ",-0.20350036025047302

5c89dac9081094006c325aab,"  Dear , you can only open the door downstairs when someone rings your doorbell. Once this is the case, you will see it on the screen. Then you can either press ""accept"" and talk to the person or immediately press ""open door"". With the latter, an icon ""Door opens"" appears. The person must stand in front of the door and pull the door open. As soon as the door is open, the contact breaks off (a bit too fast for my taste). So it's best to say in advance, ""I'll open. I live in the x. Stock.  go out the door and pull it up.""  When the icon appears, say ""drag "". I hope this helps you a bit. Otherwise, it's best to practice with someone ... Nice day!

As an immediate measure, we were advised to remain calm and not to respond to the provocation, to ignore the signs with the hope that the cooperative will correct its well-intentioned but all the worse executed self-power and apologize for the discrimination against the dog . It seems that the majority of  express themselves negatively here who do not know the contractual starting point of the hip rights.  is an urban district for a wide variety of people and interests and not an exclusive crèche. It is explicitly stated that in the general areas all  are equally placed. This is the principle of site regulation about this can be discussed but not changed. This means that you cannot simply create and determine new zones. All playgrounds are in the individual zones of the respective  and there is some possibility of action. The barbecue area, ""adventure playground"" and meadow, however, are in the red zone and these are clearly defined in the area order. The site plan is stored in the app and I assume it can be viewed by everyone. These are part of the acquisition of the property and binding. If you ask the children, the many would like to have a dog and play with you on the meadow. All courtyards are children's playgrounds. The children, however, prefer to play on the courts. Just want to go back to the binding contracts of all . A cooperative is only one part of it and has acted here on its own authority without taking into account the site regulations and without consultation with the other  and has triggered a provocation and discrimination. First with a misleading trick, because the sign does not say anything binding. Neither forbidden nor anything else. Simply you are not allowed here???? What is not allowed here? Legal nonsense. Interpersonal dramatic. Instead of spreading positive messages together and creating a great community. Stir up hatred and play off the poor children against dogs. And already the whole ""village"" has to deal with the desire of a cooperative. It already gives the impression that tolerance is not highly written. If someone writes that dogs not only on but also around everyone. Suggestion remove signs immediately and leave provocation on both sides. Dogs live very well with children. If there are aggressive dogs then we can discuss this with the affected . Ps. For me very incomprehensible that a cooperative rejects and fights the dogs so panicked,  chooses among other cooperatives,  and  which dogs are friendly. Perhaps an indoor playground would have to be built to rob children of bird / cat / fox / dog feces from dirt and to educate them clean.   ",-0.7284404449164867

Garbage bags can be thrown into the dumpsters near the construction site and the gravel site. The bags need a sticker, which you can get e.g. in the nearby Coop at its kiosk or in the Denner (a little further away than the Coop). There is a calendar for paper and cardboard removal. Should you have received it when you registered at the Lenzburg city office? Otherwise there is the online.  Unfortunately, I didn't find one for  yet. Cardboard and paper must be well bundled with string and not simply put in paper bags. Otherwise they won't take it with them... is probably a local peculiarity.

I understand your dissatisfaction and regret these circumstances.   I am writing to you following my unsuccessful call to discuss your concerns with you. Your package has been deposited at the entrance of the building. Sometimes our  drop off shipments in a safe and invisible place from the road. They thus save the  the visit to the withdrawal office. These places can be bicycle storage, carports, terraces, balconies or similar places. If the package cannot be found, please contact the  to file a search.

If it is at the foot of our boxes everyone from the road can see it, if it is at the foot of our elevators, everyone with access to our parking can go up to our commons and steal from us. In addition, as far as my package is concerned, it IS a theft since a  saw it at the foot of the elevator on . HOWever, to get to this elevator, the  passed the 1st door from the road, there is an automatic door opener for the services of the post office precisely, but from there he HAD to be opened by a  the 1st secure door leading to the elevators. From there, two inadmissible errors on his part: The 1st is that he put this package at the foot of the elevator of 37 while passing a 2nd door, not secured this one, he could have put the package at the foot of the elevator of 35, number appearing on my address. And the 2nd mistake, professional misconduct this one, is that from the elevators he could have dropped my package IN FRONT OF MY DOOR, IN WHICH CASE I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ROBBED. Please therefore consider this email as an official complaint against your services and I kindly ask you to refund this package. In case of refusal, I would forward this file to my legal protection. I am at your disposal so that qqun of your services can come and study the place and explain to me, after having seen them, why this package was left in the plan, not being a signature package.

Landscaping is delivered within a different timeframe than buildings. This is in connection with the realization of the other buildings in the district. Different temporary phases are therefore inevitable. A new phase should see the light of day in the  with more direct access to the north of the district.

The terraces are not intended to be 100% waterproof, however the floor is made to guide rainwater to the outside and thus avoid water stagnation. We therefore note your remark and will continue to follow this topic. The position on the bank of the terrace is also a factor to take into account, rainwater hitting the metal frame trickles down to the underside of the structure and drips into the underside of the balcony. The same situation is also possible in the middle of the balcony if the water continues to circulate in the underside. Finally, the current abundant rains cause the saturation of the water evacuations of the floor which can also promote these infiltrations. For the remark about rust points, we will check this point and correct it if necessary.   ",0.021000772714614868

I thought there were some great ideas and I would just like to say that I was surprised that in a new neighborhood, visibly occupied by a significant number of young couples, families in the making and families with young children, there was no more space reserved for children. I understood that the playground would occupy a small place, moreover towards the garbage cans, and I think that if we want to have a good neighborhood life it will start with the playground, where  will meet and discuss together and that we should really rethink this place 1) by moving it away from the garbage space,  2) by putting more space, 3) by putting games for all ages and 4) by placing benches and even possibly tables for picnics eventually. This space must be a beautiful meeting place. So much for youth. And I was also surprised that this new district is not primarily designed to allow people with disabilities to move easily. Could something still be done from this point of view? There are plenty of places for bikes, maybe a little too much compared to the various needs. With my thanks for your attention and I hope that we can take into account at least in part the requests expressed in this message, that would be great.   ",0.8310237284749746

They remain very cautious and do not initiate a systematic procedure, on the contrary. Having experienced it once, legal protection is better, they act directly, in writing, take up the concrete facts and impose response times. You must also participate and nurture your defense by providing supporting documents. And that's where a group comes into its own. A procedure can quickly cost 10 to 15,000 per legal protection. So we should minimize our expenses and involve only a few  who collaborate. I was assisted by a  from Lausanne and it went very well. We must launch a common procedure, quickly, otherwise the problems will continue because for the moment they do not really feel threatened, even if there is reason for it.
