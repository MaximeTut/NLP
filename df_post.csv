I assure you that it will work. 2) You separate the garbage correctly and bundle the box. Cords and ""Bebbisegg"", the official garbage bags of the city, are available for a small amount in every  or  branch. 3) You pack the mountain in your car and drive to the factory yard (direction St. Louis border), where you can dispose of everything, correctly separated of course, for little money. What is guaranteed not to work is ignore and wait for someone else to take care of it. Especially since the civil engineering office has already reliably removed the garbage a few times, down to your pile, and thus proved that they will ignore their mountain at most until St. Never's Day.

And if everyone always saves a little something, then in the end a lot has been saved.  4 simple tips on how to save hot water when washing dishes. Do not turn on the dishwasher until it is fully filled. If the dishes are only slightly soiled, the savings program is completely sufficient. Pre-rinsing is not necessary; if you do pre-rinse, use cold water for it. Instead, remove coarse food residues by hand in advance. Make sure that the dishes in the machine do not lie on top of each other so that the water can easily reach all surfaces. Even if you rinse by hand, you can save hot water. To do this, sort dishes and follow the correct order: glass, plates and cups, cutlery, plastic and only at the end pans and pots. Important: Use two basins instead of running water.

More information  This regulation is also signposted and it is important that the  here take on a role model function for outsiders. Alternative options  In the nearby Horburgpark there is a dog playground where dogs can roam freely in a specially built area. An optimal possibility for a longer run is the river Wiese, where there are beautiful paths with sufficient green areas. Also in the adjacent park Lange Erlen you can take dogs on a leash. A matter of course is the collection of the feces and the disposal of the waste bags in waste bins. Anyone who violates this rule must expect a fine of 100 francs and, above all, the anger of their fellow human beings.

I can understand your confusion regarding the correct collection and thank you for the active demand and the obvious desire to dispose of your waste correctly.   As you rightly notice, the Erlenmattareal (,  and the connecting paths) is a private area. Strictly speaking, all  would have to deposit their waste on the Allmend (). This is, of course, utopian and not feasible in practice. For this reason, the respective property administrations have installed the underfloor containers. As I said, these are located on private land, belong to the administrations and therefore have nothing to do with the vote on the public  of the canton. In practice, we empty the underfloor containers on  and  3x  (, , ) and shortly before that we drive off the route with a conventional garbage truck and clear it above ground around the . As the civil engineering office of the canton, we naturally have the key to the bollards, and the railway canteen ( 30), for example, also has a normal waste container, which is regularly emptied by the garbage truck. In principle, however, we state that we are not responsible for the cleaning of the private area. The disorder you (rightly) complain about is 100% the responsibility of the  or the property management.   Regarding your question about bulky goods removal, I can offer you 2 different options; 1.       You deposit small bulky goods directly in front of your front door or at the next  (, , ) and we clear it with the Bebbi bags. 2.       You deposit the goods on the regular collection days of the area (, ) on . Both, of course, with the official bulky goods stamps.       If you register coarse bulky goods for collection, please do so at the official bulky goods collection for the area. (Zone B, see discharge plan.) Of course, we will also serve  and  (analogous to ) on these dates, we do not want to expect the  to have to carry their old sofa  to .     For further freagen I am of course at your disposal.

58443d6cd8a58df9018b45ac,"  Just briefly: what do you think of the new PS Erlenmatt? After the recent acceptance of the protective tarpaulins and scaffolding, I am very surprised at the massive changes the city has made to the winning project (floor elevation, concrete façade, dark window frames, additional rooms on the top floor, elevation of the auditorium, etc. pp.), and how voluminous and inappropriate to its environment the whole thing has become (does not make a child-friendly impression on me). Unfortunately, much of this can no longer be changed, but  I find the sloping safety grilles on the balustrades a great visual irritation and disturbance. They remind you strongly of a fortress that shields itself from the outside world and the public or a detention centre for children and young people who cannot be socialised. It's a pity, actually, because Basel normally has an excellent school building tradition. Hence my suggestion: if there were the structural possibility, the safety grilles of the two upper floors could be installed close to the ground, with approx. half a meter safety distance to the balustrade, so that the grids are no longer so visible from the outside and you get the impression that in this building unloved children are cared for (by the way, if you want to jump, these grids will certainly not stop you – vllt. even encourage them to climb). The costs for the small conversion are likely to be very low, which is why I give the project a good chance. From a reliable source, I also k that the building department gives in here if you stubbornly act as a group (e.B. during their  conversion, the  got new windows in the entire building for a lot of money that were not budgeted for this post – and that is because the  have made themselves strong several times). At this point I would like to ask you: How do you see the whole thing (in general, and regarding? my displeasure with the grids)? Do you share the same opinion as me, or do you think ""Wow, great building! Everything is right"" If you think ""That's how it should stay!"" then I can accept that well! Nevertheless, I wanted to share my displeasure with this building. :) This opens the discussion. (But please with respect and decency) :) If several people get together and share my opinion, then you could write to the city, or send the  forward - would be my suggestion . (: Best regards, M.M.

5b280d4c7a85a100690ec5bd,"  Temperature in the  apartments Hello everyone As  &  had written on , our apartments are very warm at outside temperatures above 25°. According to Mr.  of the administration, the air can not be cooled. The supplied air also corresponds exactly to the outside air. According to the rental agreement, there is a ""Free Cooling"", which should cool the floors with cold water. Since we are currently on holiday, I have continuously measured the temperatures for the . During the measurement, all windows were closed and the blinds are lowered and tilted slightly on all Fentsers. I measured by the following points: - Outside temperature on our balcony (2. Floor) in the shade - Interior temperature in the room facing east (in the courtyard) - Temperature in the supply air duct of the same room - Temperature in the exhaust air duct in the bathroom You can see the graphics of the measurement in the post. The measurement has shown that the supply air practically never goes below 25 °C (apart from a small outcrop on . ==References== at :). However, it never rose above 26 °C. The temperature of the fresh air was always higher than the outside temperature. From approx. 21 °C outside temperature, the internal temperature rises parallel to the outside temperature. Underneath, the internal temperature remains constant. The fresh air rises from approx. 22 °C outside temperature. I conclude from this that ""free cooling"" works at least in our apartment. I also conclude that the fresh air is below an outside temperature of approx. 22 °C constant to approx. 25 °C. Since it is not possible to cool during  via the ventilation, I think it would be good if the system were set so that the temperatures at  would be slightly lower (approx. 1-2 °C). How do you see that? I look forward to your feedback.    ",2018-06-18,9,0,0,0.1828787624835968,5.154442739207298,0.1828787624835968,6,Heating

6025592b19a947179814e636,"  Dear ,  I reach you directly with my request and hope that we can clarify this without administration. The few  parking spaces in the garage are very busy. It is striking that mainly the same cars are always parked in these places, they remain there overnight. Those  who use the  parking spaces for their own purposes (be it also for the second and/or company car) should please rent a parking space (currently there are still enough free spaces) or otherwise park the car somewhere outdoors (at the community / schoolhouse square etc.). Visitor parking spaces are available to s - but the misconduct of some of you will deprive them of the opportunity to have a free parking space. In addition, many  have rented a parking space for CHF 120.-/month (CHF 1'440.-/year - a considerable sum!!!). It is not correct that others park for free . I could also use the CHF 1'440.- elsewhere. If everyone were to cancel their parking space and do the same as the fallibles, the chaos would be perfect. , many apartments are still empty. The influx of future  will certainly not improve the situation (number of s is increasing).

603ce5a189896b15c9124f53,"  Dear neighbors, I have thought for a long time whether I should post the following text and hope I do not reap too much criticism 🙈 I actually feel very comfortable here, the floor plan, the look and the location is just great but.. The ground with us looks like we have been living here for over . When the children drop toys there is immediately hicke and when a glass of water empties out, the floor curls (although I clean it away immediately). There are more and more cracks on the walls and the plaster crumbles as soon as you get to it. This can be seen especially on the dark bathroom floor. How many times the curtain rail has fallen, I can no longer count🙈 ==References== I don't want to talk about hot water.  there is only lukewarm water available (  you can still take a warm shower ) and the heating is almost never possible although I have set the controller to 6 in all rooms. It depresses me a lot as the apartments here are not cheap. If everything would be right and if you include the promises of the homepage, you are happy to pay for it ( otherwise no one would have moved in here ). I feel a bit spoiled to pay this rent in such a low quality apartment. I think we should write a letter with all the shortcomings and demand a rent reduction from the . The administration also ""only"" does its job. Because as the stand is, many will move out again  and so you can not maintain a good neighborhood if there is constantly a change.
